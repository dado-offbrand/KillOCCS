# KillOCCS

 - "Kill Oculus C#" 
 - Kills the oculus program due to it being annoying to close out.
 
<hr>
I'm not adapting the name to "Kill Meta C#". I only know it as Oculus.

# Instructions

 - Leave the file(s) anywhere, just create a shortcut and use it from there if you need. 
 - The program will automatically close itself after completion, however, double check
   if oculus is closed anyways, for the first few times at least.
